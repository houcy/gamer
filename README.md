## Game types

The first thing you need to know is that there are two types of games Gamer can work with:

1. "Place" games, such as Tic Tac Toe, Connect Four, and Othello. In a "place" game, players take turns *placing* pieces onto the board.
2. "Select and place" games, such as Checkers and Chess. In a "select and place" game, on a player's turn the player *selects* a piece, then *places* that piece.
